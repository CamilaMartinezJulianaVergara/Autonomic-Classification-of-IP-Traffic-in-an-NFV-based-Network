# Autonomic-Classification-of-IP-Traffic-in-an-NFV-based-Network
This repository contains the codes for the creation of NFV-based network, used for the generation and collection of traffic. And the datasets obtained for the training of three supervised ML algortihms.

# Synopsis 
Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is an emerging solution that improves the flexibility, efficiency, and manageability of networks by leveraging virtualization and cloud computing technologies to run networked devices in software. The implementation of NFV presents issues such as the introduction of new software components, bottleneck performance and monitoring of hidden traffic. A considerable amount of NFV traffic is invisible using traditional monitoring strategies because it does not hit a physical link. The implementation of autonomous management and supervised algorithms of Machine Learning (ML) become a key strategy to manage this hidden traffic.
